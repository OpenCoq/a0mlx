# Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network Phase Issues

This GitHub Action automatically creates issues for the 6 phases of the distributed agentic cognitive grammar network implementation.

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **"Create Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network Phase Issues"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. The workflow will create 7 issues:
   - 6 phase-specific issues (Phase 1-6)
   - 1 master tracking issue

### What Gets Created

#### Phase Issues Created:

1. **🧬 Phase 1: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding**
   - Labels: `phase-1`, `cognitive-primitives`, `hypergraph`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: Atomic vocabulary and bidirectional translation mechanisms

2. **🚀 Phase 2: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction**
   - Labels: `phase-2`, `ecan-attention`, `resource-allocation`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: Economic attention allocation and activation spreading

3. **🧠 Phase 3: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels**
   - Labels: `phase-3`, `neural-symbolic`, `ggml-kernels`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: Custom kernels for neural-symbolic computation

4. **🌐 Phase 4: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer**
   - Labels: `phase-4`, `api-development`, `embodiment`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: REST/WebSocket APIs and Unity3D/ROS bindings

5. **🔄 Phase 5: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization**
   - Labels: `phase-5`, `meta-cognition`, `evolutionary-optimization`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: Self-observation and recursive improvement

6. **📚 Phase 6: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification**
   - Labels: `phase-6`, `testing`, `documentation`, `enhancement`
   - Focus: Comprehensive testing and cognitive unity

#### Master Tracking Issue:

- **🧬 Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network - Master Tracking**
  - Labels: `master-tracking`, `distributed-cognitive-grammar`, `epic`
  - Provides overview of all phases and implementation flow

## Implementation Flow

```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
Primitives → ECAN → Neural-Sym → APIs → Meta-Cog → Unity
```

Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a recursive self-optimization spiral toward cognitive unity.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 6 phases from the original specification
- **Detailed Sub-Tasks**: Each phase includes specific, actionable sub-steps
- **Proper Labeling**: Issues are labeled for easy filtering and organization
- **Tracking Integration**: Master issue provides high-level progress tracking
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Uses only GitHub-native features

## Permissions Required

The workflow requires the following permissions:
- `issues: write` - To create issues
- `contents: read` - To checkout the repository

## Customization

You can modify the workflow file at `.github/workflows/create-phase-issues.yml` to:
- Change issue titles or descriptions
- Modify labels
- Add additional phases
- Customize the master tracking issue

## Manual Issue Creation

If you prefer to create issues manually, you can use the issue templates provided in each step of the workflow as a reference for the markdown content.
